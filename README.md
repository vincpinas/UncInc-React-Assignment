# Unc Inc Assessment - React

This package contains the assessment for a typical React project.

## Requirements

- Yarn 1.22 or higher
- Node 10 or higher
- Git (preferably command line)
- Your editor of choice

## Installation

The directory contains a very basic `create-react-app` setup. Unarchive the package into a directory, and do:

Install all packages:
```
$ yarn install
```

To run the app:
```
$ yarn run start
```

To run the tests:
```
$ yarn run test
```

## Usage

Run the app and confirm that you see an example React app being opened in your browser.

## Assignment

We would like you to develop a Paginator component, e.g. like https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_pagination.asp. The interaction should be very minimal, at the very least it should have a state of the current page, and an indication of the current page. This component should have props defining how many pages and other options. We would like a very minimal styling (do not spend too much on this).

Secondly, we would also like to test this component using several different situations. We have provided a basic test framework.

## Rules

There is a small set of rules we would like you to adhere to:

- The project needs to be versioned using git. Please make us of a local git repository to keep track of your changes (You need to start a repo by using git init). We try to adhere to Conventional Commits as much as we can.
- Try to adhere to standards as much as you can. Use conventions set by the framework(s). Your code should follow the coding standards.
- Do not write unnecessary code. Use packages or libraries where you can.
- Do not spend too much time on this. Think practically, act as if a client is waiting for your changes.
- If you can not finish the assignment within a reasonable amount of time, just write down your train of thoughts and steps you would like to take. We are looking more into your approach, not so much perfect code.

## Hints

Some hints to help you along the way:

- A testing framework has already been setup, try to make use of that.

## Submission

Create an archive of the full project, including the `.git` folder and database and either email it or transfer it using e.g. WeTransfer or ToffeeShare.
Also do include a README or SOLUTION document explaining how you approaced the assignment, we are interested in your thoughts more than a perfect solution.
